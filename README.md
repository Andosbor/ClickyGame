# ClickyGame
This app was an introduction to React.js where I made a memory game. I was able to use reusable components to fill up the page with 12 pictures of characters from garfield that shuffle around on the loading of the page.
I was able to use props to fill in each click box with a unique picture randomly and then shuffle the pictures when one is clicked.
The current build needs to flesh out the use of state so keep track of which pictures have been clicked. I can then increment the score from each time the user clicks on a picture that hasn't already been clicked and compare the final score with the top score.
